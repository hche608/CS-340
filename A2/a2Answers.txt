Q1.
If this synchronisation implementation cope with a large number of files, and if there are a large number of different files, then the synchronisation implementation will sync all different files which means it will take a lot of time, and it is not efficient, due to some pair of files may just have one line different and this synchronisation implementation will copy the whole file.
    
Q2.
Assumption1,
If there are two files, which have same file same in the different directories, by using the assumption from the hand-out, we choose the latest modified version and copy it to another directory, which can causes a problem, we should ask user make the decision.
Assumption2,
We cannot monitor files in real-time, whcih means we can keep .sync file update, we assume use this app carefully, it may be a case, a file was modified more than once, but only the app is executed then the last modified time of the file would be update to .sync file. Hence, if the file system can notify the app if the file was changed, then the app can update the .sync file. we also need to check if the .sync is valid, the .sync may be casue some problem, the app should able to check it.
